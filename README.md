# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis

This is a machine learning algorithm used to segregate a dataset into different categories. It helps to visualize analysts about the type of groups that exist from a dataset. 
This algorithm segregates the different groups by increasing the distance between the means of each group and by decreasing the standard deviation of each group. 
I'll explain further through the code.
